        <p style="text-align:left; font-size:1rem">Now, we proceed to the main part of the study, which consists of <b>four blocks of product decisions</b>, each containing 18 trials.
            Additionally, there will be <b>one block with 18 trials where we present policy packages</b>, and we ask you to decide whether you would support or oppose them.

Before each block, you will receive instructions for the upcoming task.
    Similar to the practice run, product attributes and policy package components will be concealed behind boxes.
    To reveal the information, hover your mouse pointer over the box, and it will open, allowing you to see the details.

Look for the zoom settings at the top of the page, typically located in the menu bar of most common browsers ("View" tab). This allows you to customize the task and text size according to your preference.</b>
